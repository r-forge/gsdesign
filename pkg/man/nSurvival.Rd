\title{3.3: Time-to-event sample size calculation (Lachin-Foulkes)}
\description{\code{nSurvival()} is used to calculate the sample size for a clinical trial with a time-to-event endpoint. The Lachin and Foulkes (1986) method is used.
}

\usage{
nSurvival(lambda.0, lambda.1, Ts, Tr, eta = 0, rand.ratio = 1,
      alpha = 0.05, beta = 0.10, sided = 2, approx = FALSE,
      type = c("rr", "rd"), entry = c("unif", "expo"), gamma = NA)
}
\arguments{
  \item{lambda.0, lambda.1}{event hazard rate for placebo and treatment
    group respectively.}
  \item{eta}{equal dropout hazard rate for both groups.}
  \item{rand.ratio}{randomization ratio between placebo and treatment
    group. Default is balanced design, i.e., randomization ratio is 1.}
  \item{Ts}{maximum study duration.}
  \item{Tr}{accrual (recruitment) duration.}
  \item{alpha}{type I error rate. Default is 0.05 since 2-sided testing is default.}
  \item{beta}{type II error rate. Default is 0.10 (90\% power).}
  \item{sided}{one or two-sided test? Default is two-sided test.}
  \item{approx}{logical. If \code{TRUE}, the approximation sample size
    formula for risk difference is used.}
  \item{type}{type of sample size calculation: risk ratio (\dQuote{rr}) or risk
    difference (\dQuote{rd}).}
  \item{entry}{patient entry type: uniform entry (\code{"unif"}) or exponential
    entry (\code{"expo"}).}
  \item{gamma}{rate parameter for exponential entry. \code{NA} if entry type is
    \code{"unif"} (uniform). A non-zero value is supplied if entry type is
    \code{"expo"} (exponential).} 
}

\details{
  \code{nSurvival} produces the number of subjects and events for a set of
  pre-specified trial parameters, such as accrual duration and follow-up
  period. The calculation is based on Lachin and Foulkes method and can
  be used for risk ratio or risk difference. The function also consider
  non-uniform entry as well as uniform entry. 

  If the logical approx is \code{TRUE}, the variance under alternative
  hypothesis is used to replace the variance under null hypothesis.

  For non-uniform entry. a non-zero value of gamma for exponential entry
  must be supplied. For positive gamma, the entry distribution is
  convex, whereas for negative gamma, the entry distribution is concave.
}

\title{2.4: Conditional Power Computation}
\description{
\code{gsCP()} takes a given group sequential design, assumes an interim z-statistic 
at a specified interim analysis and computes boundary crossing probabilities at future planned analyses.
}

\usage{
gsCP(x, theta=NULL, i=1, zi=0, r=18)
}
\arguments{
	\item{x}{An object of type \code{gsDesign} or \code{gsProbability}}
	\item{theta}{\eqn{\theta}{theta} value(s) at which conditional power is to be computed; if \code{NULL}, 
	an estimated value of \eqn{\theta}{theta} based on the interim test statistic (\code{zi/sqrt(x$n.I[i])}) as well as at \code{x$theta}
	is computed.}
	\item{i}{analysis at which interim z-value is given}
	\item{zi}{interim z-value at analysis i (scalar)}
	\item{r}{Integer value controlling grid for numerical integration as in Jennison and Turnbull (2000); 
	default is 18, range is 1 to 80. 
	Larger values provide larger number of grid points and greater accuracy.
	Normally \code{r} will not be changed by the user.}
}
\value{
An object of the class \code{gsProbability}.
Based on the input design and the interim test statistic, the output object has bounds for test statistics
computed based on observations after interim \code{i} that are equivalent to the original design crossing boundaries conditional
on the interim test statistic value input. 
Boundary crossing probabilities are computed for the input 
\eqn{\theta}{theta} values.

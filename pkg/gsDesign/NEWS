2.9-4
- Minor edit to package description to comply with R standards

2.9-3, November, 2014
- Added sfTrimmed as likely preferred spending function approach to skipping early or all interim efficacy analyses; this also can adjust bound when final analysis is performed with less than maximum planned information. Updated help(sfTrimmed) to demonstrate these capabilities.
- Added sfGapped, which is primarily intended to eliminate futility analyses later in a study; see help(sfGapped) for an example
- Added summary.spendfn to provide textual summary of spending functions; this simplified the print function for gsDesign objects
- Added sfStep which can be used to set an interim spend when the exact amount of information is unknown; an example of how this can be misused is provided in the help file.
- Fixed rounding so that gsBoundSummary, xtable.gsSurv and summary.gsDesign are consistent for gsSurv objects

2.9-4, July, 2015
- Added initial version of nBinomial1Sample to compute sample size and power for 1-sample binomial testing.
